CHAT JSON FORMAT PROMPT (Primary Model)
================================================================================
File: src/services/api/gemini.js
Location: Inside geminiService.chat() method, line ~692
Purpose: Appended to every user message to request structured JSON response
Used by: Primary chat model (gemini-2.0-flash)
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object (no markdown, no explanation). Use this exact format:
{
  "response": "your conversational response here",
  "follow_up_questions": [],
  "quick_replies": [],
  "concerns_detected": false,
  "suggested_action": "continue_chat",
  "urgency_level": "low",
  "symptoms_mentioned": [],
  "possible_conditions": [],
  "recommended_actions": [],
  "home_care_tips": [],
  "should_see_vet": false,
  "emergency_steps": []
}

Field guidelines:
- response: Your helpful, conversational message. When you have follow-up questions, include them at the END of your message as a numbered list like this:
  "...your response text...

  1) First question here?
  2) Second question here?
  3) Third question here?"

  This makes it clear and easy to read. Do NOT put questions scattered throughout the message - group them at the end.
- follow_up_questions: Same questions as numbered in your response (for internal tracking)
- quick_replies: 3-5 SHORT clickable response options the user can tap to answer quickly. These should be:
  * Direct answers to your follow_up_questions (e.g., "Yes, constantly", "No", "Sometimes")
  * Helpful responses to narrow down the issue (e.g., "It appeared suddenly", "Getting worse")
  * Common next questions (e.g., "What should I do?", "Is it serious?")
  * Uncertainty options (e.g., "I'm not sure", "Let me check")
  * Keep each reply SHORT (2-5 words max)
- concerns_detected: true if user mentions ANY health symptom or concern
- suggested_action: "continue_chat" | "upload_photo" | "see_vet" | "emergency"
- urgency_level: "low" | "moderate" | "urgent" | "emergency" (based on symptom severity)
- symptoms_mentioned: List symptoms the user described (e.g., ["vomiting", "lethargy"])
- possible_conditions: If concerns detected, list 2-4 possible causes
- recommended_actions: 2-4 actionable steps the owner should take
- home_care_tips: 1-3 home care suggestions (if appropriate)
- should_see_vet: true if professional vet visit is recommended
- emergency_steps: For EMERGENCIES ONLY, 2-4 immediate first-aid steps

IMPORTANT: When the user describes symptoms or health concerns, ALWAYS populate the structured fields (symptoms_mentioned, possible_conditions, recommended_actions). Keep "response" conversational but put the detailed breakdown in the structured fields.

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS include quick_replies with 3-5 short, tappable responses that help the user answer your questions or continue the conversation.
